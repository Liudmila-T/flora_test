Description:
Using the Flutter framework build a test app containing two screens (see link above).
Use the BLoC library to navigate screens(based on states).
The design shows two screens, however, there should be a last (third) screen with an arbitrary design, that should show a summary of selections from the previous two screens in text fields.
Create a git repository containing your code. Provide the link.
